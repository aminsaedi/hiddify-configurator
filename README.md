## Overview
The **Hiddify Setup Script** provides a streamlined way to deploy and configure the [**Hiddify**](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config) application on a Digital Ocean Droplet. This script utilizes [Terraform 竊余(https://www.terraform.io/) to provision the virtual machine on Digital Ocean and [Ansible 竊余(https://www.ansible.com/) to install the required packages and configure the application.

## Prerequisites

Before using the setup script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform 竊余(https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your local machine.
- [Ansible 竊余(https://www.ansible.com/) installed on your local machine.
- A Digital Ocean account with API credentials.
- A Cloudflare account with API credentials with write access to your DNS zone
- Your Cloudflare zone id

## Configuration
Before you run the script you have to update the variable files to set your api keys. The file name that you have to modify is `terraform.tfvars`. Here is a sample configuration:
```terraform

```
